    "text": "Implementing Simple Linear Regression in R\nLinear regression in R is accomplished with the lm() function, which stands for “linear model.” Let’s look at how to use a sample dataset to construct a simple linear regression.\nStep 1: Data Loading and Exploration\nWe’ll utilize a sample dataset of data for this demonstration.csv file with two variables: X as independent variable and Y as dependent variable.\n\nStep 2: Data Visualization Visualizing the data before applying linear regression aids in understanding the relationship between variables.\n\nStep 3: Linear Model Fit Let’s now design a linear regression model based on X to predict Y.\n\nStep 4: Create a Regression Line On the scatter plot, draw the regression line as follows.\n\nStep 5: Making Prognoses The model can be used to forecast fresh data:\n\nConclusion\nIt is simple to implement linear regression in R, allowing us to analyze the relationship between variables, make predictions, and gain important insights from the data."
